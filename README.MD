* The essential idea with a factory design pattern is that rather than instantiating the objects ourself we can call a factory class object which will create objects dynamically for us, however we do not have 
  a full control over the configuration of the objects we are creating for this purpose builder design pattern is being used.

* Builder design pattern gives more control over configuration of the object. I have mentioned rest of the things in more detail inside the  builder_design_pattern.py file.
