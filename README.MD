* The essential idea with a factory design pattern is that rather than instantiating the objects ourself we can call a factory class object which will create objects dynamically for us, however we do not have 
  a full control over the configuration of the objects we are creating for this purpose builder design pattern is being used.

* Builder design pattern gives more control over configuration of the object. I have mentioned rest of the things in more detail inside the  builder_design_pattern.py file.

* Singleton pattern, a singleton is just a class that can only have one instance of it. This is used to mainatain just single instance of the application.

* The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. Here, the subject is monitored by a group of observers wherein each observer is responsible to accomplish a different task. Whenever the state of the observable subject changes, all observers are notified about the change.
